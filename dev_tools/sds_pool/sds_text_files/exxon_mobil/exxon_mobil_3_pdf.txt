If a leak or spill has not ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors and to protect personnel attempting to stop a leak.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to protect personnel. Unusual Fire Hazards:  Highly flammable.  Vapors are flammable and heavier than air.  Vapors may travel across the ground and reach remote ignition sources causing a flashback fire danger.  Hazardous material. Firefighters should consider protective equipment indicated in Section 8.Hazardous Combustion Products:   Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon, Smoke, FumeFLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES Flash Point [Method]:  -32°C  (-26°F)  [ASTM D-56]Flammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air):   LEL:  1.2     UEL: 7.0Autoignition Temperature:   263°C  (505°F)  [ASTM E659] SECTION 6ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURESNOTIFICATION PROCEDURESIn the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable regulations. US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.PROTECTIVE MEASURESAvoid contact with spilled material.  Warn or evacuate occupants in surrounding and downwind areas if required due to toxicity or flammability of the material.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders.For emergency responders:  Respiratory protection: half-face or full-face respirator with filter(s) for organic vapor and, when applicable, H2S, or Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) can be used depending on the size of spill and potential level of exposure.  If the exposure cannot be completely characterized or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is possible or anticipated, SCBA is recommended.  Work gloves that are resistant to aromatic hydrocarbons are recommended.  Note: gloves made of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) are not water-resistant and are not suitable for emergency use.  Chemical goggles are recommended if splashes or contact with eyes is possible.  Small spills: normal antistatic work clothes are usually adequate.  Large spills: full body suit of chemical resistant, antistatic material is recommended. SPILL MANAGEMENTLand Spill:  Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area).  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded.  Do not touch or walk through spilled material.  Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basements or confined areas.  A vapor suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors.  Use clean non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material.  Absorb or cover with dry earth, sand or other non-combustible material and transfer to containers.  Large Spills:  Water spray may reduce vapor; but may not prevent ignition in closed spaces. Product Name:   EXXSOL™ METHYLPENTANE NAPHTHA ANTI-STATIC Revision Date:  29 Mar 2018 Page 5 of 13 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Water Spill:  Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area).  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Do not confine in area of spill.  Advise occupants and shipping in downwind areas of fire and explosion hazard and warn them to stay clear.  Allow liquid to evaporate from the surface.  Seek the advice of a specialist before using dispersants.Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONSLarge Spills:  Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. SECTION 7HANDLING AND STORAGEHANDLINGAvoid contact with skin.  Prevent exposure to ignition sources, for example use non-sparking tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Potentially toxic/irritating fumes/vapors may be evolved from heated or agitated material.  Use only with adequate ventilation. Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. Material can accumulate static charges which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source).  Use proper bonding and/or ground procedures.  However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation.  Consult local applicable standards for guidance.  Additional references include American Petroleum Institute 2003 (Protection Against Ignitions Arising out of Static, Lightning and Stray Currents) or National Fire Protection Agency 77 (Recommended Practice on Static Electricity) or CENELEC CLC/TR 50404 (Electrostatics - Code of practice for the avoidance of hazards due to static electricity).Loading/Unloading Temperature:     [Ambient]Transport Temperature:     [Ambient] Transport Pressure:     [Ambient]Static Accumulator:   This material is a static accumulator.  A liquid is typically considered a nonconductive, static accumulator if its conductivity is below 100 pS/m (100x10E-12 Siemens per meter) and is considered a semiconductive, static accumulator if its conductivity is below 10,000 pS/m.  Whether a liquid is nonconductive or semiconductive, the precautions are the same.  A number of factors, for example liquid temperature, presence of contaminants, anti-static additives and filtration can greatly influence the conductivity of a liquid.STORAGEAmple fire water supply should be available.  A fixed sprinkler/deluge system is recommended.  The  type of container used to store the material may affect static accumulation and dissipation.  Keep container closed. Handle containers with care. Open slowly in order to control possible pressure release.  Store in a cool, well-ventilated area.   Outside or detached storage preferred.  Storage containers should be grounded and bonded.  Fixed storage containers, transfer containers and associated equipment should be grounded and bonded to prevent accumulation of static charge.Storage Temperature:       [Ambient]Storage Pressure:     [Ambient]Suitable Containers/Packing:   Tankers; Drums; Tank Cars; Tank TrucksSuitable Materials and Coatings (Chemical Compatibility):   Carbon Steel; Stainless Steel; Teflon;  Product Name:   EXXSOL™ METHYLPENTANE NAPHTHA ANTI-STATIC Revision Date:  29 Mar 2018 Page 6 of 13 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Polyethylene; Polypropylene; Cast Iron Unsuitable Materials and Coatings:   Butyl Rubber; Polystyrene; Ethylene-proplyene-diene monomer (EPDM); Natural Rubber    SECTION 8EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTIONEXPOSURE LIMIT VALUESExposure limits/standards (Note: Exposure limits are not additive) Substance NameFormLimit / StandardNOTESourceN-HEXANETWA1800 mg/m3500 ppmN/AOSHA Z1N-HEXANETWA50 ppmSkinACGIHNAPHTHA (PETROLEUM), HYDROTREATED LIGHTTWA400 mg/m3100 ppmN/AOSHA Z1NAPHTHA (PETROLEUM), HYDROTREATED LIGHTVapor.RCP - TWA1200 mg/m3353 ppmTotal HydrocarbonsExxonMobil     NOTE: Limits/standards shown for guidance only.

Small amounts of liquid aspirated into the lungs during ingestion or from vomiting may cause chemical pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.  Exposure to this material, or one of its components, in situations where there is the potential for high levels, such as in confined spaces or with abuse, may result in abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).  High-level exposure to hydrocarbons (above occupational exposure limits) may initiate arrhythmia in a worker that is undergoing stress or is taking a heart-stimulating substance such as epinephrine, a nasal decongestant, or an asthma or cardiovascular drug.Contains:N-HEXANE: Prolonged and/or repeated exposures to n-Hexane can cause progressive and potentially irreversible damage to the peripheral nervous system (e.g. fingers, feet, arms, legs, etc.).  Simultaneous exposure to Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) or Methyl Isobutyl Ketone (MIBK) and n-Hexane can potentiate the risk of adverse effects from n-Hexane on the peripheral nervous system.  n-Hexane has been shown to cause testicular damage at high doses in male rats.  The relevance of this effect for humans is unknown.  In the EU/EEA, n-hexane-containing products have mandatory classification thresholds for n-hexane content as specified in Table 3.1 of Annex VI (EU CLP) for Category 2 reproductive toxicity (H361f) and Category 2 target organ toxicity, repeated exposure (H373). There is sufficient information from specialized toxicity testing that demonstrates that these thresholds are not applicable to this product outside the EU/EEA.
