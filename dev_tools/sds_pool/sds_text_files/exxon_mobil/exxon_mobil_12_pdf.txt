 Product Name:   HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE - Grades designated by HD or HDP prefix Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 1 of 13 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ExxonMobil Chemical Company22777 Springwoods Village ParkwaySpring, TX 77389-1425Subject: OSHA Hazard Communication 2012 Combustible Dust LabelingDear ExxonMobil Customer:As you may be aware, in March 2012, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its final Hazard Communication Standard which stated its intent to adopt the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the classification and labeling of hazardous substances.  This updated hazard communication standard requires product labels for hazardous substances and mixtures.  In addition to product labels, the standard requires suppliers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), previously known as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), for all hazardous products.The UN GHS does not contain a classification for combustible dust hazards.  The combustible dust hazard was an element OSHA desired to include in its standard.  As such, OSHA amended the standard definition of 'hazardous chemical' to include 'combustible dust' which has resulted in a hazard classification of certain polymer materials and the need to provide a hazard label.  For polymer materials presenting a combustible dust hazard as shipped, a label will be applied to each package.  For polymers that do not present a combustible dust hazard in the shipped form, OSHA permits the transmittal of label information with the SDS.  Enclosed please find the combustible dust label for the referenced product.If you have any questions, please direct them to your ExxonMobil Customer Service Representative. Product Name:   HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE - Grades designated by HD or HDP prefix Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 2 of 13 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Please find below an OSHA HazCom 2012 label for HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE - for combustible dust hazard.HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE - Grades designated by HD or HDP prefixCIOL - EXXONMOBIL CHEMICAL CANADAP.O.

Evacuate area.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to protect personnel. Unusual Fire Hazards:  Explosion: Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient concentration and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard.Hazardous Combustion Products:   Flammable hydrocarbons, Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon, Smoke, FumeFLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES Flash Point [Method]:  N/AFlammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air):  LEL:  N/D     UEL:  N/DAutoignition Temperature:  N/A  SECTION 6ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURESNOTIFICATION PROCEDURESIn the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable regulations. US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.PROTECTIVE MEASURESAvoid contact with spilled material.  Dust Deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an explosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration.  Avoid dispersal of dust in the air (for example, clearing dust surfaces with compressed air).  Prevent dust exposure to ignition sources.  For example, use non-sparking tools and prohibit smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders. SPILL MANAGEMENTLand Spill:  Spilled pellets present a slipping hazard on hard surfaces.  Prevent dust cloud.  Small Dry  Product Name:   HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE - Grades designated by HD or HDP prefix Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 6 of 13 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Spills:  With clean shovel place material into clean, dry container and cover loosely; move containers from spill area.Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other shipping.  Skim from surface.Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONSPrevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.  For Large Spills: Cover spill with plastic sheet or tarpaulin to minimize spreading. SECTION 7HANDLING AND STORAGEHANDLINGMinimize dust generation and accumulation.  Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  Dust from material can accumulate electrostatic charges due to friction from transfer and mixing operations and cause an electrical spark (ignition source).  Provide adequate precautions to ignition sources, such as electrical grounding and bonding, inert atmosphere or non-sparking tools. However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard for static accumulation.  Consult local applicable standards for guidance.  Refer to NFPA 654, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust Explosions from the Manufacturing, Processing, and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids and EN 61241, Electrical Apparatus for Use in the Presence of Combustible Dust for safe handling.  Avoid elevated temperatures for prolonged periods of time.  Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. DO NOT handle, store or open near an open flame, sources of heat or sources of ignition. Protect material from direct sunlight.  Care should be taken when storing and handling this product. Apart from the specific nature of the polymer product, conditions such as humidity, sunlight, and temperature have an influence on the way the product behaves during storage and handling. Special attention should be paid to avoid inappropriate stacking of palletized bags or other package units. Indeed, polymer products may be dimensionally unstable under certain conditions.  Avoid conditions generating heat during transfer operations.Loading/Unloading Temperature:     [Ambient]Transport Temperature:     [Ambient] Transport Pressure:     [Ambient]Static Accumulator:   This material is a static accumulator.STORAGEThe  type of container used to store the material may affect static accumulation and dissipation.
