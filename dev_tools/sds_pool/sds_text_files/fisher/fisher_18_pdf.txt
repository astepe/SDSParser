Remove and washcontaminated clothing before re-use. Call a physician immediately.InhalationIf breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested orinhaled the substance; give artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped witha one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Remove from exposure, liedown. Call a physician immediately.IngestionDo not induce vomiting. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Cleanmouth with water. Call a physician immediately.Most important symptoms andeffectsCauses burns by all exposure routes.  Ingestion causes severe swelling, severe damage tothe delicate tissue and danger of perforation: Product is a corrosive material.  Use of gastriclavage or emesis is contraindicated.
