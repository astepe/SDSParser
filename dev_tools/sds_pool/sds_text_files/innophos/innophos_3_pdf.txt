Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult. Give artificial respiration if victim is not breathing. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim inhaled the substance; give artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Get medical attention.SkinlIn case of contact with substance, immediately flush skin with running water for at least 20 minutes. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. For minor skin contact, avoid spreading material on unaffected skin. Get medical attention.EyelIn case of contact with substance, immediately flush eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Seek immediate medical attention, preferably with an ophthalmologist. If the physician is not immediately available, eye irrigation should be continued for an additional 15 minutes. If it is necessary to transport the patient to a physician and the eye needs to be bandaged, use a dry sterile cloth pad and cover both eyes.IngestionlIf swallowed give 2-3 glasses of water if victim is conscious and alert. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Do NOT induce vomiting. Seek immediate medical attention. Do not leave victim unattended. Vomiting may occur spontaneously. To prevent aspiration of swallowed product, lay victim on side with head lower than waist. If vomiting occurs and the victim is conscious, give water to further dilute the chemical.4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayedlRefer to Section 11 - Toxicological Information.4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment neededNotes to PhysicianlAll treatments should be based on observed signs and symptoms of distress in the patient. Consideration should be given to the possibility that overexposure to materials other than this product may have occurred.4.4 Other informationlCall 911 or emergency medical service. Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved and take precautions to protect themselves. Keep victim warm and quiet.Section 5 - Firefighting MeasuresTrisodium Phosphate Dodecahydrate FCCTrisodium Phosphate Dodecahydrate FCCTrisodium Phosphate Dodecahydrate FCCTrisodium Phosphate Dodecahydrate FCCPreparation Date:  14/October/2014Preparation Date:  14/October/2014Preparation Date:  14/October/2014Preparation Date:  14/October/2014Revision Date:  14/October/2014Revision Date:  14/October/2014Revision Date:  14/October/2014Revision Date:  14/October/2014Format: EU CLP/REACH Language: English (US)Format: EU CLP/REACH Language: English (US)Format: EU CLP/REACH Language: English (US)Format: EU CLP/REACH Language: English (US)WHMIS, EU CLP, EU DSD/DPD, OSHA HCS 2012WHMIS, EU CLP, EU DSD/DPD, OSHA HCS 2012WHMIS, EU CLP, EU DSD/DPD, OSHA HCS 2012WHMIS, EU CLP, EU DSD/DPD, OSHA HCS 2012Page 4 of 13Page 4 of 13Page 4 of 13Page 4 of 135.1 Extinguishing mediaSuitable Extinguishing MedialNot combustible.

Under fire conditions, toxic, corrosive fumes are emitted. Hazardous Combustion ProductslOxides of sodium, oxides of phosphorus. 5.3 Advice for firefighterslWear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Structural firefighters' protective clothing provides limited protection in fire situations ONLY; it is not effective in spill situations where direct contact with the substance is possible. Keep unauthorized personnel away. Dike area to prevent runoff and contamination of water sources. Dispose of fire control water later. Persons who may have been exposed to contaminated smoke should be immediately examined by a physician and checked for symptoms of poisoning. The symptoms should not be mistaken for heat exhaustion or smoke inhalation.
