Ecological Information  Toxicity  Aquatic toxicity Assessment of aquatic toxicity:  Safety Data Sheet   ULTRAMID A3HG3 UNCOLORED POLYAMIDE Revision date : 2017/09/28 Page: 8/9 Version: 5.0 (30043115/SDS_GEN_US/EN)   The product has not been tested. The statement has been derived from the structure of the product. There is a high probability that the product is not acutely harmful to aquatic organisms.   Persistence and degradability  Assessment biodegradation and elimination (H2O) Experience shows this product to be inert and non-degradable.   The product is virtually insoluble in water and can thus be separated from water mechanically in suitable effluent treatment plants.   Bioaccumulative potential  Bioaccumulation potential Because of the product's consistency and low water solubility, bioavailability is improbable.   13.
