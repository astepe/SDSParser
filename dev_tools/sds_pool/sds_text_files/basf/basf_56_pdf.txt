Accidental release measures Further accidental release measures: High risk of slipping due to leakage/spillage of product.   Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures No special precautions necessary.   Environmental precautions This product is not regulated by CERCLA ('Superfund'). This product is not regulated by RCRA.   No special precautions necessary.   Methods and material for containment and cleaning up For small amounts: Pick up with suitable appliance and dispose of.  For large amounts: Pick up with suitable appliance and dispose of.    7. Handling and Storage Precautions for safe handling Provide suitable exhaust ventilation at the drying process and in the area surrounding the melt outlet of processing machines. Closed containers should only be opened in well-ventilated areas. Ensure thorough ventilation of stores and work areas.   Any short stoppages in production, it is recommended that you inject material into the mould not purge an air shot. Any molten material drooling from the machine nozzle or hot runner nozzles can self-ignite when in open atmosphere. It is therefore advisable to dispose of purgings etc into water containers.   For additional guidelines and recommendations see the product-specific "Processing Data Sheet".   Protection against fire and explosion: Take precautionary measures against static discharges.   Handling of hot melt may produce small flame-up conditions.  Hot melt should be placed in cool water immediately if flame-up occurs.   Safety Data Sheet   ULTRAMID A3X2G5 BLACK 23187 POLYAMIDE Revision date : 2018/01/01 Page: 4/10 Version: 5.0 (30045145/SDS_GEN_US/EN)    Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities  Suitable materials for containers: Low density polyethylene (LDPE), High density polyethylene (HDPE), Aluminium, Carbon steel (Iron)   Further information on storage conditions: Keep container tightly closed.
