FIRST-AID MEASURES      General advice:     Remove contaminated clothing.     Contact the local poison control center or call BASF Emergency     Response at 1-800-832-HELP (4357).     If inhaled:     Keep patient calm, remove to fresh air.     If breathing difficulties develop, aid in breathing and seek     immediate medical attention.      If on skin:     Wash affected areas with water for at least 15 minutes.     If irritation develops, seek medical attention.      If in eyes:     Flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes.     Hold eyelids open to facilitate rinsing.     Seek medical attention.      If swallowed:     Rinse mouth and then drink plenty of water.     Do not induce vomiting due to aspiration hazard.     Never induce vomiting or give anything by mouth if the victim is     unconscious or having convulsions.     Immediate medical attention is required.     Ingestion may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract.       Safety data sheet   Methyl Ethyl Ketone 99.5% Revision date : 2006/01/06 Page: 3/8 Version: 1.0 (30082888/CDU_GEN_US/EN)         Aspiration may result in chemical pneumonitis, which may be fatal. ______________________________________________________________________  5.  FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES      Flash point: 16 °F (-9 °C) (closed cup)     Lower explosion limit: 1.8 VOL%     Upper explosion limit: 11.5 VOL%      Suitable extinguishing media:     Use alcohol type aqueous foam for large fires.     Use carbon dioxide or dry chemical for small fires.      Unsuitable extinguishing media for safety reasons:     Water spray      Hazards during firefighting:     Flammable gases/vapors.     Vapors and/or decomposition products are irritants and/or toxic.     If product is heated above decomposition temperatures, acrid smoke     and fumes will be released.      Protective equipment for firefighting:     Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and turn-out gear.      Further information:     Vapors are heavier than air and may accumulate in low areas and     travel a considerable distance up to the source of ignition. Flash     fire may occur.     Remove product from areas of fire or otherwise cool sealed     containers with water in order to avoid pressure build-up due to     heat.     Do not flood burning material with water due to potential     spreading of fire.     Contain contaminated water/firefighting water.     Run-off water from fire may cause pollution.     Notify proper authorities. ______________________________________________________________________  6.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES      Personal precautions:     Extinguish sources of ignition nearby and downwind.     Wear suitable personal protective clothing and equipment.     Ensure adequate ventilation.     Avoid prolonged inhalation.     Avoid contact with skin and eyes.     Use antistatic tools.      Environmental precautions:       Safety data sheet   Methyl Ethyl Ketone 99.5% Revision date : 2006/01/06 Page: 4/8 Version: 1.0 (30082888/CDU_GEN_US/EN)         Do not discharge into drains/surface waters/groundwater.     A spill of or in excess of the reportable quantity requires     notification to state, local and national emergency authorities.          Cleanup:     Dike spillage.     Place into appropriately labeled waste containers.     Spills should be contained, solidified, and placed in suitable     containers for disposal. ______________________________________________________________________  7.  HANDLING AND STORAGE      HANDLING      General advice:     Ensure adequate ventilation.     Do not puncture, drop or slide containers.     Use static lines when mixing and transferring material.     Handle and open container with care.     Avoid contact with the skin, eyes and clothing.     WARNING: Empty containers may still contain hazardous residue.     Do not apply to hot surfaces.     Proper ventilation and respiratory protection is required when     sanding, flame cutting, welding or brazing coated surfaces.      Protection against fire and explosion:     Use antistatic tools.     Exhaust fans should be explosion proof.     Provide adequate ventilation to remove solvent vapors from lower     levels or work areas and to prevent solvent contact with ignition     sources.     Sealed containers should be protected against heat as this results     in pressure build-up.     Risk of explosion if heated under confinement.     Avoid all sources of ignition: heat, sparks, or open flame.      STORAGE      General advice:     Store in a cool, dry, well ventilated area.     Keep away from heat and ignition sources.     Keep container tightly closed.     Protect from direct sunlight.     Consult local fire marshal for storage requirements.      Storage incompatability:     General:  Segregate from incompatible substances.     Segregate from oxidizing agents.     Segregate from strong bases.       Safety data sheet   Methyl Ethyl Ketone 99.5% Revision date : 2006/01/06 Page: 5/8 Version: 1.0 (30082888/CDU_GEN_US/EN)         Segregate from strong acids.     Segregate from amines, ammonia, aldehydes, halogens.     Segregate from hydrogen peroxide. ______________________________________________________________________  8.  EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION      COMPONENTS WITH WORKPLACE CONTROL PARAMETERS     See section 2.      ADVICE ON SYSTEM DESIGN     Provide local exhaust ventilation to maintain recommended P.E.L.     General mechanical ventilation should comply with OSHA 1910.94.      PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT      Respiratory protection:     Respiratory protection may not be required under normal operating     conditions if adequate ventilation is provided.     Wear respiratory protection if ventilation is inadequate.     Wear NIOSH-certified (or equivalent) organic vapor respirator.     Particulate filters should be added during spray operations.     Do not exceed the maximum use concentration for the respirator     facepiece/cartridge combination.     Observe OSHA regulations for respirator use (29 CFR 1910.134).      Hand protection:     Use appropriate chemically resistant gloves as determined by an     evaluation of glove performance characteristics and the hazards     and potential hazards identified, including but not limited to     butyl, natural  and synthetic rubber, nitrile, or neoprene.      Eye protection:     Tightly fitting safety goggles (chemical goggles).     Wear face shield if splashing hazard exists.      Body protection:     Body protection must be chosen based on activity level and     exposure.      General safety and hygiene measures:     Work place should be equipped with a shower and eye wash.     Contact lenses should not be worn.     Remove contaminated clothing.     Contaminated equipment or clothing should be cleaned after each     use or disposed of.     Hands and/or face should be washed before breaks and at the end of     the shift. ______________________________________________________________________        Safety data sheet   Methyl Ethyl Ketone 99.5% Revision date : 2006/01/06 Page: 6/8 Version: 1.0 (30082888/CDU_GEN_US/EN)     9.
