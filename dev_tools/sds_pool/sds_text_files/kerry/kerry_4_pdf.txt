SECTION 4: First aid measures  4.1 Description of first aid measures Conforms to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (REACH), Annex II, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/830 MOCHA FLV LQD 70377105 20KG Page:4/19   Version: 0.0 Date of issue/Date of revision:  14.09.2018 Date of previous issue: 00.00.0000    Eye contact : Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids. Check for and remove any contact lenses. Continue to rinse for at least 10 minutes. Get medical attention.  Inhalation : Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest occurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Get medical attention if adverse health effects persist or are severe. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.  Skin contact : Flush contaminated skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention if symptoms occur. Wash clothing before reuse. Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.  Ingestion : Wash out mouth with water. Remove dentures if any. Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If material has been swallowed and the exposed person is conscious, give small quantities of water to drink. Stop if the exposed person feels sick as vomiting may be dangerous. Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. If vomiting occurs, the head should be kept low so that vomit does not enter the lungs. Get medical attention if adverse health effects persist or are severe. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.  Protection of first-aiders : No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.

Hazardous combustion products : Decomposition products may include the following materials: carbon dioxide carbon monoxide   5.3 Advice for firefighters  Special protective actions for fire-fighters : Promptly isolate the scene by removing all persons from the vicinity of the incident if there is a fire. No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training. Move containers from fire area if this can be done without risk. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool.  Special protective equipment for fire-fighters : Fire-fighters should wear appropriate protective equipment and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece operated in positive pressure mode. Clothing for fire-fighters (including helmets, protective boots and gloves) conforming to European standard EN 469 will provide a basic level of protection for chemical incidents.   SECTION 6: Accidental release measures  6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures  For non-emergency personnel : No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training. Evacuate surrounding areas. Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from entering. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Shut off all ignition sources. No flares, smoking or flames in hazard area. Avoid breathing vapor or mist. Provide adequate ventilation. Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate. Put on appropriate personal protective equipment.  For emergency responders : If specialized clothing is required to deal with the spillage, take note of any information in Section 8 on suitable and unsuitable materials. See also the information in "For non-emergency personnel".   6.2 Environmental precautions : Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and sewers. Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).  6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up  Small spill : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble. Alternatively, or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Large spill : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Approach release from upwind. Prevent entry into sewers, water courses, basements or confined areas. Wash spillages into an effluent treatment plant or proceed as follows. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal according to Conforms to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (REACH), Annex II, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/830 MOCHA FLV LQD 70377105 20KG Page:6/19   Version: 0.0 Date of issue/Date of revision:  14.09.2018 Date of previous issue: 00.00.0000   local regulations.

Eye/face protection : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles.   Skin protection     Hand protection : Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.    Body protection : Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product., When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti-static protective clothing., For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing should include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves., Refer to European Standard EN 1149 for further information on material and design requirements and test methods.    Other skin protection : Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  Respiratory protection : Based on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the appropriate standard or certification. Respirators must be used according to a respiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important aspects of use.  Environmental exposure controls : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.
