Accidental release measuresStop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Approach release from upwind.  Prevent entry into sewers,water courses, basements or confined areas.  Wash spillages into an effluent treatment plant or proceed as follows.  Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible,absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal according to local regulations (see Section 13).  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.  Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as the spilled product.  Note: see Section 1 for emergency contact information and Section 13 for waste disposal.Large spill:Stop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble.  Alternatively,or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container.  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.Small spill:Section 7. Handling and storageAdvice on general occupational hygieneConditions for safe storage,including any incompatibilitiesEating, drinking and smoking should be prohibited in areas where this material is handled, stored and processed.  Workers should wash hands and face before eating,drinking and smoking.  Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas.  See also Section 8 for additional information on hygiene measures.Store in accordance with local regulations.  Store in a segregated and approved area.Store in original container protected from direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area, away from incompatible materials (see Section 10) and food and drink.  Eliminate all ignition sources.  Separate from oxidizing materials.  Keep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use.  Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage.  Do not store in unlabeled containers.Use appropriate containment to avoid environmental contamination.::Protective measuresPut on appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8).  Persons with a history of skin sensitization problems should not be employed in any process in which this product is used.  Do not get in eyes or on skin or clothing.  Do not ingest.  Avoid breathing vapor or mist.  Use only with adequate ventilation.  Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate.  Do not enter storage areas and confined spaces unless adequately ventilated.  Keep in the original container or an approved alternative made from a compatible material, kept tightly closed when not in use.  Store and use away from heat, sparks, open flame or any other ignition source.  Use explosion-proof electrical (ventilating, lighting and material handling) equipment.  Use only non-sparking tools.

Exposure controls/personal protectionHand protectionBased on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the appropriate standard or certification.  Respirators must be used according to a respiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important aspects of use.Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary.  Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties.  It should be noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove manufacturers.  In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,gases or dusts.  If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection:  chemical splash goggles.Eye/face protectionRespiratory protection:::Body protectionPersonal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.:Environmental exposure controls:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation.  In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace.  Wash contaminated clothing before reusing.  Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.Hygiene measures:Individual protection measuresSkin protectionOther skin protection:Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.Section 9.
