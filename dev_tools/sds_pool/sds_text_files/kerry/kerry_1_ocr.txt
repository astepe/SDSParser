assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,
gases or dusts. lf contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless
the asseSsment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles.

: Chemicai-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be

worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is
necessary. Considering the parameters speciﬁed by the glove manufacturer, check
during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be
noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different
glove manufacturers. in the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the
protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.
