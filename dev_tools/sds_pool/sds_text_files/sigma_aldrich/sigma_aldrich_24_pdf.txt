HANDLING AND STORAGE 7.1 Precautions for safe handling Further processing of solid materials may result in the formation of combustible dusts. The potential for combustible dust formation should be taken into consideration before additional processing occurs. Provide appropriate exhaust ventilation at places where dust is formed. For precautions see section 2.2. 7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place.  Recommended storage temperature -20 °C  Sigma - C1386 Page 3  of  7  Keep in a dry place.  Storage class (TRGS 510): 13: Non Combustible Solids 7.3 Specific end use(s) Apart from the uses mentioned in section 1.2 no other specific uses are stipulated  8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 8.1 Control parameters Components with workplace control parameters Contains no substances with occupational exposure limit values. 8.2 Exposure controls Appropriate engineering controls General industrial hygiene practice. Personal protective equipment Eye/face protection Use equipment for eye protection tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or EN 166(EU). Skin protection Handle with gloves. Gloves must be inspected prior to use. Use proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface) to avoid skin contact with this product. Dispose of contaminated gloves after use in accordance with applicable laws and good laboratory practices. Wash and dry hands.  Full contact Material: Nitrile rubber Minimum layer thickness: 0.11 mm Break through time: 480 min Material tested:Dermatril® (KCL 740 / Aldrich Z677272, Size M)  Splash contact Material: Nitrile rubber Minimum layer thickness: 0.11 mm Break through time: 480 min Material tested:Dermatril® (KCL 740 / Aldrich Z677272, Size M)  data source: KCL GmbH, D-36124 Eichenzell, phone +49 (0)6659 87300, e-mail sales@kcl.de, test method: EN374 If used in solution, or mixed with other substances, and under conditions which differ from EN 374, contact the supplier of the CE approved gloves. This recommendation is advisory only and must be evaluated by an industrial hygienist and safety officer familiar with the specific situation of anticipated use by our customers. It should not be construed as offering an approval for any specific use scenario.  Body Protection Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and to the specific work-place., The type of protective equipment must be selected according to the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace. Respiratory protection Respiratory protection is not required. Where protection from nuisance  levels of dusts are desired, use type N95 (US) or type P1 (EN 143) dust masks. Use respirators and components tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU). Control of environmental exposure No special environmental precautions required.  9.
