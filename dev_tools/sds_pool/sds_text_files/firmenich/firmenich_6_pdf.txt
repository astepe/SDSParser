PHYSICAL DATAVapor pressure (At 20C in mm Hg ) : 113.2Vapor density (Air = 1)                     :  > 1Solubility in water                             : Not applicablePhysical state                                   : LIQUIDIII. FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD INFORMATIONFlash point(Clos. cup) = 46 Fahrenheit (= 8 Centigrade)Flammable liquid by OSHA classification.Extinguishing media: Foam, carbon dioxide or dry chemicalUnusual Fire And Explosion Hazards:Closed containers may build up pressure if exposed to heat (fire). Vapors form explosive mixtures with air andmay travel to a source of ignition and flash back.Fire Fighting Procedures:Cool fire exposed containers with water spray.IV.  REACTIVITY INFORMATIONStability:Presents no significant reactivity hazard. Normally stable even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Avoidtemperatures above or near to the flash point. Not pyrophoric nor reactive with water. Does not undergoexplosive decomposition, is shock stable, and is not an oxygen donor. Does not form explosive mixtures withother organic materials. Will not undergo hazardous exothermic polymerization.Incompatibility (Materials To Avoid):Avoid strong oxidizing agents.V.

In view of the difficulty of using current standardtoxicological evaluation techniques to predict potential hazards to susceptible individuals or arising fromunforeseeable potentiation, this preparation should be considered and handled as if it displayed healthhazards and treated in consequence with all possible precaution.Ecological InformationThis preparation has not been subjected to ecotoxicological testing as an entity. In view of the difficulty ofusing current standard ecotoxicological evaluation techniques to predict the impact of particular modes ofrelease on vulnerable or localised parts of the ecosystem, this preparation should be considered and handledas if it displayed potential environmental hazards, and treated in consequence with all possible precaution.Health Hazard Determination:The identity of individual components of this mixture is proprietary information and is regarded to be a tradesecret.However, based on a health hazard determination of the individual components of this mixture the individualcomponents may present the following health hazards.Prolonged skin contact or ingestion at high levels may affect the reproductive process.Prolonged or repeated skin contact in the presence of light may cause photo-irritation.May be irritating to skin and eyes.Vapor may be irritant to eyes, nose, throat and respiratory tract.Prolonged inhalation at high levels may cause serious health effects.It may also cause  anesthesia , headache , loss of muscle coordination , mental confusion , nausea/vomiting ,rapid heart beat .Prolonged or repeated ingestion at high level may affect the  liver , reproductive system .It may also cause  anesthesia , headache , loss of muscle coordination , mental confusion , nausea/vomiting ,rapid heart beat .VI. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURESEye (Contact):In the event of contact with the eyes,  irrigate with water for at least 15 minutes; obtain medical advice ifirritation persists.Skin (Contact):Remove contaminated clothes. Wash affected area with water. If irritation persists, obtain medical advice.Ingestion (Swallowing):In the event of accidental ingestion, rinse mouth with water. Give up to one tumbler (half pint) of milk or water.Obtain medical advise immediately.

Obtainmedical advice immediately.VII. HANDLING AND SPILL/LEAK PROCEDURESEmpty all containers using a two stage pumping system or draining until no free liquid remainsSteps To Be Taken If Material Is Released Or Spilled:Eliminate all sources of ignition.  Leaking containers should be removed to a well ventilated area if possible todo safely.  If not, dike around container to limit spread of spill, leak.  If spill/leak is small, clean up with standardabsorbents (sand, vermiculite , etc.). Wear rubber gloves.  Avoid contact with skin. If skin contact occurs, washliberally with soap and water.  See Section VI above. If large leak/spill, call HAZMAT Team.Vapors may cause vomiting and nausea. Wear appropriate respiratory protection.Waste Disposal Method:Incineration or sanitary landfill in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.VIII. SPECIAL PROTECTION INFORMATIONRespiratory Protection:Breathing of the vapors or dust particles may be hazardous. In the absence of appropriate engineeringcontrols such as spot ventilation, ventilated enclosures, etc., workers should avail themselves of theappropriate NIOSH approved respiratory protection.Ventilation:The appropriate engineering controls such as mechanical ventilation must be used to ensure the TLV, PEL, orSTEL is not exceeded.  Open containers in a well ventilated area.Protective Gloves:Oil resistant gloves.Eye protection:Splash - proof safety goggles.Other protective equipment:None required.
