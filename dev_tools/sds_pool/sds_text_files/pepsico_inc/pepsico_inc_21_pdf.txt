If ingestion of a large amount does occur, call apoison control centre immediately.General adviceIf you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where possible).5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURESSuitable extinguishing mediaWater fog. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Alcohol resistant foam. Powder.Extinguishing media whichmust not be used for safetyreasonsWater. Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.Unusual fire & explosionhazardsContainers may explode when heated. Heat may cause the containers to explode.Special protective equipmentfor fire-fightersWear full protective clothing, including helmet, self-contained positive pressure or pressuredemand breathing apparatus, protective clothing and face mask.

Self-contained breathing apparatusand full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. Use standard firefighting procedures andconsider the hazards of other involved materials. Move container from fire area if it can be donewithout risk.6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURESPersonal precautionsKeep unnecessary personnel away. Ventilate closed spaces before entering. Do not touch damagedcontainers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Keep upwind. Keepout of low areas. Ventilate closed spaces before entering them. Stay upwind.Environmental precautionsPrevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Contact local authorities in case of spillage todrain/aquatic environment. Avoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground.Containment proceduresEliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). ELIMINATEall ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Stop the flow ofmaterial, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this is possible. Prevent entry intowaterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basementsor confined areas.Methods for cleaning upExtinguish all flames in the vicinity.Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this ispossible. Cover with plastic sheet to prevent spreading. Use a non-combustible material likevermiculite, sand or earth to soak up the product and place into a container for later disposal.Clean contaminated surface thoroughly. Following product recovery, flush area with water.Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly toremove residual contamination.Never return spills in original containers for re-use. This material and its container must bedisposed of as hazardous waste. For waste disposal, see section 13.7. HANDLING AND STORAGEHandlingMay be ignited by open flame. Keep away from sources of ignition - No smoking. Use only withadequate ventilation. Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Avoid prolonged exposure.StorageDo not handle or store near an open flame, heat or other sources of ignition. Keep in awell-ventilated place. Prevent electrostatic charge build-up by using common bonding andgrounding techniques. Refrigeration recommended. Store in a well-ventilated place.8.
