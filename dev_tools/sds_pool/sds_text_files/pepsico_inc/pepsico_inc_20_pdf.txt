Accidental release measuresPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency proceduresKeep unnecessary personnel away. For personal protection, see section 8.For non-emergencypersonnelKeep unnecessary personnel away. Use personal protection recommended in Section 8 of the SDS.For emergencyrespondersAvoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground.Environmental precautionsLarge Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this ispossible. Cover with plastic sheet to prevent spreading. Use water spray to reduce vapours or divertvapour cloud drift. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers. Followingproduct recovery, flush area with water.Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly toremove residual contamination.Never return spills to original containers for re-use. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.Methods and materials forcontainment and cleaning up7. Handling and storageAvoid prolonged exposure. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.Precautions for safe handlingStore in original tightly closed container.

Ventilation rates shouldbe matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or otherengineering controls to maintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If exposurelimits have not been established, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level.Appropriate engineeringcontrolsIndividual protection measures, for example personal protective equipment (PPE)Wear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).Eye/face protectionSkin protectionWear appropriate chemical resistant gloves.
