Ventilate closed spaces beforeentering them. Stay upwind.Environmental precautionsPrevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not contaminate water.Methods for containmentEliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). ELIMINATEall ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Stop the flow ofmaterial, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this is possible. Use water spray toreduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements orconfined areas. Prevent entry into waterways, sewer, basements or confined areas.Methods for cleaning upShould not be released into the environment.Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this ispossible. Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later disposal. Cover with plastic sheet to preventspreading. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers. Clean contaminatedsurface thoroughly. Following product recovery, flush area with water.Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly toremove residual contamination.Never return spills in original containers for re-use.
