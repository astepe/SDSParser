FIRST AID MEASURES Description of first aid measures General advice:  First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the recommended protective clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 8 for specific personal protective equipment.    Inhalation: Move person to fresh air; if effects occur, consult a physician.    Skin contact: Remove material from skin immediately by washing with soap and plenty of water.  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing.  Seek medical attention if irritation persists. Wash clothing before reuse.  Discard items which cannot be decontaminated, including leather articles such as shoes, belts and watchbands.  Suitable emergency safety shower facility should be available in work area.    Eye contact: Flush eyes thoroughly with water for several minutes.  Remove contact lenses after the initial 1-2 minutes and continue flushing for several additional minutes.  If effects occur, consult a physician, preferably an ophthalmologist.    Ingestion: No emergency medical treatment necessary.    Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information.  Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Notes to physician: No specific antidote.  Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient.    5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media: To extinguish combustible residues of this product use water fog, carbon dioxide, dry chemical or foam.    Unsuitable extinguishing media: None known.    Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture Hazardous combustion products: Under fire conditions some components of this product may decompose.

If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, general ventilation should be sufficient for most operations.  Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.    Individual protection measures Eye/face protection: Use safety glasses (with side shields).   Skin protection Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material.  Examples of preferred glove barrier materials include:  Chlorinated polyethylene.  Polyethylene.  Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate ("EVAL").  Styrene/butadiene rubber.  Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Butyl rubber.  Natural rubber ("latex").  Nitrile/butadiene rubber ("nitrile" or "NBR").  Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC" or "vinyl").  Viton.  Avoid gloves made of:  Neoprene.  Polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA").  NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier.   Other protection: Use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material.  Selection of specific items such as face shield, boots, apron, or full body suit will depend on the task.   Respiratory protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk assessment process.  For most conditions no respiratory protection should be needed;  however, if discomfort is experienced, use an approved air-purifying respirator.   The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge with a particulate pre-filter.     9.
