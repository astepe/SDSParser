FIRST AID MEASURES Description of first aid measures General advice:  First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the recommended protective clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 8 for specific personal protective equipment.    Inhalation: Move person to fresh air.  If not breathing, give artificial respiration; if by mouth to mouth use rescuer protection (pocket mask, etc).  If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel.  Call a physician or transport to a medical facility.    Skin contact: Immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing.  Seek medical attention if symptoms occur or irritation persists.  Wash clothing before reuse.  Suitable emergency safety shower facility should be immediately available.    Eye contact: Wash immediately and continuously with flowing water for at least 30 minutes.  Remove contact lenses after the first 5 minutes and continue washing. Obtain prompt medical consultation, preferably from an ophthalmologist.  Suitable emergency eye wash facility should be immediately available.    Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting. Give one cup (8 ounces or 240 ml) of water or milk if available and transport to a medical facility. Do not give anything by mouth unless the person is fully conscious.    Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information.  Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Notes to physician: May cause asthma-like (reactive airways) symptoms.  Bronchodilators, expectorants, antitussives and corticosteroids may be of help.  Respiratory symptoms, including pulmonary edema, may be delayed. Persons receiving significant exposure should be observed 24-48 hours for signs of respiratory distress.  Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation of the patient.  Chemical eye burns may require extended irrigation.  Obtain prompt consultation, preferably from an ophthalmologist.  If burn is present, treat as any thermal burn, after decontamination.  Due to irritant properties, swallowing may result in burns/ulceration of mouth, stomach and lower gastrointestinal tract with subsequent stricture. Aspiration of vomitus may cause lung injury. Suggest endotracheal/esophageal control if lavage is done.  No specific antidote.  Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient.  Excessive exposure may aggravate preexisting asthma and other respiratory disorders (e.g. emphysema, bronchitis, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome).    5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media:   Water fog or fine spray.  Dry chemical fire extinguishers.  Foam.    Unsuitable extinguishing media: No information currently available.      Product name: Acetic Acid, Glacial Issue Date: 10/25/2018    Page 4 of 12  Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture Hazardous combustion products: Carbon monoxide.

Combustion products may include and are not limited to:    Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:   Vapors are heavier than air and may travel a long distance and accumulate in low lying areas. Ignition and/or flash back may occur.      Advice for firefighters Fire Fighting Procedures: Use water spray to cool fire-exposed containers and fire-affected zone until fire is out.  Use water spray to cool fire exposed containers and fire affected zone until fire is out and danger of reignition has passed.    Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves).  Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves).  Use appropriate safety equipment. For additional information, refer to Section 8, Exposure Controls and Personal Protection.    6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Evacuate area.  Use appropriate safety equipment. For additional information, refer to Section 8, Exposure Controls and Personal Protection.  Ventilate area of leak or spill.  Only trained and properly protected personnel must be involved in clean-up operations.    Environmental precautions: Spills or discharge to natural waterways is likely to kill aquatic organisms.  Prevent from entering into soil, ditches, sewers, waterways and/or groundwater. See Section 12, Ecological Information.    Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Absorb with materials such as:  Fill in Picklist  Collect in suitable and properly labeled containers.  See Section 13, Disposal Considerations, for additional information.  See Section 13, Disposal Considerations, for additional information.  Small spills:  Large spills:  Absorb with materials such as:  Fill in Picklist  Collect in suitable and properly labeled containers.  Use fine water spray to reduce vapors.  Dilute with large quantities of water.  Knock down and dilute vapors with water fog or spray.  Isolate area until gas has dispersed.  Pump into suitable and properly labeled containers.    7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Precautions for safe handling: Wash thoroughly after handling.  Keep away from heat, sparks and flame.  Keep container closed.  Use with adequate ventilation.  Do not get in eyes, on skin, on clothing.  Do not swallow.  Avoid breathing vapor or mist.  Handling operations that can promote accumulation of static charges include but are not limited to mixing, filtering, pumping at high flow rates, splash filling, creating mists or sprays, tank and container filling, tank cleaning, sampling, gauging, switch loading, vacuum truck operations.

EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION Control parameters If exposure limits exist, they are listed below.  If no exposure limits are displayed, then no values are applicable. Component Regulation Type of listing Value/Notation Acetic acid ACGIH TWA    10 ppm  ACGIH STEL    15 ppm  OSHA Z-1 TWA  25 mg/m3  10 ppm  Exposure controls Engineering controls: Use local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, general ventilation should be sufficient for most operations.  Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.    Individual protection measures Eye/face protection: Use chemical goggles.  If exposure causes eye discomfort, use a full-face respirator.   Skin protection Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material.  Examples of preferred glove barrier materials include:  Chlorinated polyethylene.  Neoprene.  Polyethylene.  Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate ("EVAL").  Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC" or "vinyl").  Viton.  Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Butyl rubber.  Natural rubber ("latex").  Nitrile/butadiene rubber ("nitrile" or "NBR").  Avoid gloves made of:  Polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA").  NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier.   Other protection: Use protective clothing chemically resistant to this material.  Selection of specific items such as face shield, boots, apron, or full body suit will depend on the task.   Respiratory protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk assessment process.  For emergency conditions, use an approved positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus.   The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge.     9.
