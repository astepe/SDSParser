FIRST AID MEASURES Description of first aid measures General advice:  First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection and use the recommended protective clothing (chemical resistant gloves, splash protection).  If potential for exposure exists refer to Section 8 for specific personal protective equipment.    Inhalation: Move person to fresh air; if effects occur, consult a physician.    Skin contact: Wash off with plenty of water.    Eye contact: Immediately flush eyes with water; remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes, then continue flushing eyes for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical attention without delay, Product name: TERGITOL™ LF-20 Surfactant Issue Date: 12/05/2018    Page 3 of 11  preferably from an ophthalmologist.  Suitable emergency eye wash facility should be immediately available.    Ingestion: If swallowed, seek medical attention.  Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel.    Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed:  Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information.  Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Notes to physician: No specific antidote.  Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient.    5. FIREFIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media: Water fog or fine spray.  Dry chemical fire extinguishers.  Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.  Foam.  Alcohol resistant foams (ATC type) are preferred. General purpose synthetic foams (including AFFF) or protein foams may function, but will be less effective.    Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use direct water stream.  May spread fire.    Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture Hazardous combustion products: During a fire, smoke may contain the original material in addition to combustion products of varying composition which may be toxic and/or irritating.  Combustion products may include and are not limited to:  Carbon monoxide.  Carbon dioxide.    Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids.      Advice for firefighters Fire Fighting Procedures: Keep people away.  Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry.  Burning liquids may be extinguished by dilution with water.  Do not use direct water stream. May spread fire.  Burning liquids may be moved by flushing with water to protect personnel and minimize property damage.  Contain fire water run-off if possible. Fire water run-off, if not contained, may cause environmental damage.  Review the "Accidental Release Measures" and the "Ecological Information" sections of this (M)SDS.    Special protective equipment for firefighters: Wear positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and protective fire fighting clothing (includes fire fighting helmet, coat, trousers, boots, and gloves).  If protective equipment is not available or not used, fight fire from a protected location or safe distance.    6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: Isolate area.  Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from entering the area.  Refer to section 7, Handling, for additional precautionary measures.  Spilled material may cause a slipping hazard.  Use appropriate safety equipment. For additional information, refer to Section 8, Exposure Controls and Personal Protection.   Product name: TERGITOL™ LF-20 Surfactant Issue Date: 12/05/2018    Page 4 of 11   Environmental precautions: Spills or discharge to natural waterways is likely to kill aquatic organisms.  Prevent from entering into soil, ditches, sewers, waterways and/or groundwater. See Section 12, Ecological Information.    Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up: Contain spilled material if possible.  Absorb with materials such as:  Sand.  Dirt.  Do not use water for cleanup.  Collect in suitable and properly labeled containers.  See Section 13, Disposal Considerations, for additional information.    7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Precautions for safe handling: Avoid contact with eyes.  Do not swallow.  Wash thoroughly after handling.  See Section 8, EXPOSURE CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION.    Conditions for safe storage: No specific requirements.  Additional storage and handling information on this product may be obtained by calling your sales or customer service contact.  The shelf life given is for unopened containers stored under moderate temperature conditions.    Storage stability   Shelf life:  Use within     24 Month   8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION Control parameters If exposure limits exist, they are listed below.  If no exposure limits are displayed, then no values are applicable.  Exposure controls Engineering controls: Use local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, general ventilation should be sufficient for most operations.  Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.    Individual protection measures Eye/face protection: Use chemical goggles.   Skin protection Hand protection: Use gloves chemically resistant to this material when prolonged or frequently repeated contact could occur.  Examples of preferred glove barrier materials include:  Butyl rubber.  Chlorinated polyethylene.  Polyethylene.  Ethyl vinyl alcohol laminate ("EVAL").  Polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA").  Styrene/butadiene rubber.  Examples of acceptable glove barrier materials include:  Natural rubber ("latex").  Neoprene.  Nitrile/butadiene rubber ("nitrile" or "NBR").  Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC" or "vinyl").  Viton.  NOTICE: The selection of a specific glove for a particular application and duration of use in a workplace should also take into account all relevant workplace factors such as, but not limited to: Other chemicals which may be handled, physical requirements (cut/puncture protection, dexterity, thermal protection), potential body reactions to glove materials, as well as the instructions/specifications provided by the glove supplier.   Other protection: Wear clean, body-covering clothing.   Product name: TERGITOL™ LF-20 Surfactant Issue Date: 12/05/2018    Page 5 of 11  Respiratory protection: Respiratory protection should be worn when there is a potential to exceed the exposure limit requirements or guidelines.  If there are no applicable exposure limit requirements or guidelines, wear respiratory protection when adverse effects, such as respiratory irritation or discomfort have been experienced, or where indicated by your risk assessment process.  In misty atmospheres, use an approved particulate respirator.   The following should be effective types of air-purifying respirators:  Organic vapor cartridge with a particulate pre-filter.     9.
