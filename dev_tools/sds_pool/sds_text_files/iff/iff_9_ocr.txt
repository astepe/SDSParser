Hygiene measures

Protective measures

c)if normal operational workplace vapor concentration in the air is
increased due to heat ;

d)during emergencies; or

e)if engineering controls and operational practices are not sufﬁcient
to reduce airborne concentrations below an established occupational
exposure limit.

: To the extent deemed appropriate, implement pre-placement and

regularly scheduled ascertainment of symptoms and spirometry
testing of lung function for workers who are regularly exposed to
this material.

To the extent deemed appropriate, use an experienced air sampling
expert to identify and measure volatile chemicals that could be
present in the workplace air to determine potential exposures and to
ensure the continuing effectiveness of engineering controls and

' operational practices to minimize exposure.

In December 2003, the National institute for Occupational Safety
and Health ("NIOSH") published an Alert on preventing lung
disease in workers who use or make ﬂavorings [NIOSH Publication
Number 2004-1 10].

In August 2004, the United States Flavor and Extract Manufacturers
Association (FEMA) issued a report entitled "Respiratory Safety in
the Flavor Manufactur mg Workplace".

Both of these reports provide 1ecommendations for reducing

A employee exposure and for medical surveillance in the workplace.

The recommendations in these reports are generally applicable to the
use of any chemical in the workplace and you are strongly urged to
review both of these repo1ts.

The repoﬂ published by FEMA also contains a list of "high priority"
chemicals. If any of these chemicals are present in this product at a
concentration >= 1.0% due to an intentional addition by IFF, the
chemical(s) will be identiﬁed in this safety data sheet.
