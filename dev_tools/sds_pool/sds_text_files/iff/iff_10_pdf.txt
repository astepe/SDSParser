SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE  Handling : Avoid excessive inhalation of concentrated vapors. Follow good manufacturing practices for housekeeping and personal hygiene. Wash any exposed skin immediately after any chemical contact, before breaks and meals, and at the end of each work period. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be thoroughly cleaned before re-use.  If appropriate, procedures used during the handling of this material should also be used when cleaning equipment or removing residual chemicals from tanks or other containers, especially when steam or hot water is used, as this may increase vapor concentrations in the workplace air. Where chemicals are openly handled, access should be restricted to properly trained employees. Keep all heated processes at the lowest necessary temperature in order to minimize emissions of volatile chemicals into the air.  Advice on protection against fire and explosion : Keep away from ignition sources and naked flame.   Requirements for storage areas and containers : Store in a cool, dry, ventilated area away from heat sources. Keep containers upright and tightly closed when not in use.   SECTION 8.

Maintain these areas under negative air pressure relative to the rest of the plant. Where feasible, use closed systems to transfer and process this material   Personal protective equipment Eye protection : Use tight-fitting goggles, face shield or safety glasses with side shields if eye contact might occur.  Hand protection : Avoid skin contact. Use chemically resistant gloves.  Respiratory protection : Use local exhaust ventilation around open tanks and other open sources of potential exposures in order to avoid excessive inhalation, including places where this material is openly weighed or measured.  In addition, use general dilution ventilation of the work area to eliminate or reduce possible worker exposures. No respiratory protection is required during normal operations in a workplace where engineering controls such as adequate ventilation, etc. are sufficient.  If engineering controls and safe work practices are not sufficient, an approved, properly fitted respirator with organic vapor cartridges or  SAFETY DATA SHEET INTERNATIONAL  FLAVORS  &  FRAGRANCES  Product CARDAMOM   Print Date  08/22/2017 Page    6  (10)         Version :  3 Revision Date :  08/22/2017   IFF Inc. 150 Docks Corner Road Dayton NJ  08810-0439     IFF Inc. 150 Docks Corner Road Dayton NJ  08810-0439   Telephone: +17323294600  Telefax: +17323295634  canisters and particulate filters should be used:  a)while engineering controls and appropriate safe work practices and/or procedures are being implemented; or b)during short term maintenance procedures  when engineering controls are not in normal operation or are not sufficient; or c)if normal operational workplace vapor concentration in the air is increased due to heat ; d)during emergencies; or e)if engineering controls and operational practices are not sufficient to reduce airborne concentrations below an established occupational exposure limit.  Hygiene measures : To the extent deemed appropriate, implement pre-placement and regularly scheduled ascertainment of symptoms and spirometry testing of lung function for workers who are regularly exposed to this material. To the extent deemed appropriate, use an experienced air sampling expert to identify and measure volatile chemicals that could be present in the workplace air to determine potential exposures and to ensure the continuing effectiveness of engineering controls and operational practices to minimize exposure.  Protective measures : In December 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ("NIOSH") published an Alert on preventing lung disease in workers who use or make flavorings [NIOSH Publication Number 2004-110]. In August 2004, the United States Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) issued a report entitled "Respiratory Safety in the Flavor Manufacturing Workplace". Both of these reports provide recommendations for reducing employee exposure and for medical surveillance in the workplace. The recommendations in these reports are generally applicable to the use of any chemical in the workplace and you are strongly urged to review both of these reports. The report published by FEMA also contains a list of "high priority" chemicals. If any of these chemicals are present in this product at a  SAFETY DATA SHEET INTERNATIONAL  FLAVORS  &  FRAGRANCES  Product CARDAMOM   Print Date  08/22/2017 Page    7  (10)         Version :  3 Revision Date :  08/22/2017   IFF Inc. 150 Docks Corner Road Dayton NJ  08810-0439     IFF Inc. 150 Docks Corner Road Dayton NJ  08810-0439   Telephone: +17323294600  Telefax: +17323295634  concentration >= 1.0% due to an intentional addition by IFF, the chemical(s) will be identified in this safety data sheet.
