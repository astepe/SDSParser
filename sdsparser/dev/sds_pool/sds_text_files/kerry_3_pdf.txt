Check for and remove any contact lenses. Continue to rinse for at least 10 minutes. Get medical attention.  Inhalation : Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest occurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Get medical attention if adverse health effects persist or are severe. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.  Skin contact : Flush contaminated skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention if symptoms occur. Wash clothing before reuse. Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.  Ingestion : Wash out mouth with water. Remove dentures if any. Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If material has been swallowed and the exposed person is conscious, give small quantities of water to drink. Stop if the exposed person feels sick as vomiting may be dangerous. Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. If vomiting occurs, the head should be kept low so that vomit does not enter the lungs. Get medical attention if adverse health effects persist or are severe. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.  Protection of first-aiders : No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training. It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.   4.2 Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed    Potential acute health effects  Eye contact : Causes serious eye irritation.

Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble. Alternatively, or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Large spill : Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Approach release from upwind. Prevent entry into sewers, water courses, basements or confined areas. Wash spillages into an effluent treatment plant or proceed as follows. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal according to local regulations. Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as the spilled product.  6.4 Reference to other sections : See Section 1 for emergency contact information.
