4. FIRST AID MEASURES

 

4.1 Description of first-aid measures

 

General advice

Eye contact

Skin contact

Ingestion

Inhalation

If symptoms persist, call a physician

Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 minutes If
symptoms persist, call a physician Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial
flushing, remove any contact lenses and continue flushing for at least 15 minutes Keep eye
wide open while rinsing

None

5.3 Advice for firefighters

 

Special protective equipment for fire-fighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

 

 

6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures

 

Use personal protective equipment. Avoid contact with the skin and the eyes. Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuate personnel
to safe areas. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Pay attention to flashback. Take precautionary measures against
static discharges.

See Section 12 for additional Ecological Information

6.2 Environmental precautions

 

Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system.
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains.

6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up

 

Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust)

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

 

 

7.1 Precautions for safe handling

Ensure adequate ventilation. Wear personal protective equipment. Use only in area provided with appropriate exhaust ventilation.
Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. To avoid ignition of vapors by static electricity discharge, all metal parts of the equipment
must be grounded. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. No smoking. Take necessary action to avoid static electricity
discharge (which might cause ignition of organic vapors).

 

 

7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities

Keep container tightly closed. Keep out of the reach of children. Keep away from heat and sources of ignition. Keep containers
tightly closed in a cool, well-ventilated place. Keep in properly labeled containers. Keep away from heat.
