4. FIRST AID MEASURES

 

4.1 Description of first-aid measures

 

General advice

Eye contact

Skin contact

Ingestion

Inhalation

Protection of First-aiders

If symptoms persist, call a physician Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray Do
not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing

Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial flushing, remove any contact lenses and
continue flushing for at least 15 minutes Keep eye wide open while rinsing If symptoms
persist, call a physician

Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated
clothes and shoes. Consult a physician if necessary. Remove and wash contaminated
clothing before re-use. Wash off immediately with plenty of water. If skin irritation persists,
call a physician. Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water. Immediate medical
attention is not required.

Do NOT induce vomiting. Drink plenty of water. If symptoms persist, call a physician. Rinse
mouth. Clean mouth with water and drink afterwards plenty of water. Never give anything by
mouth to an unconscious person. Consult a physician.

Move to fresh air. If breathing is irregular or stopped, administer artificial respiration. Avoid
direct contact with skin. Use barrier to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Consult a
physician. Immediate medical attention is not required. Move to fresh air in case of
accidental inhalation of vapors. If symptoms persist, call a physician. Move to fresh air in
case of accidental inhalation of vapors or decomposition products.

Use personal protective equipment

None

5.3 Advice for firefighters

 

Special protective equipment for fire-fighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear

 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

 

6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures

 

Evacuate personnel to safe areas. Remove all sources of ignition. Ensure adequate ventilation. Keep people away from and
upwind of spill/leak. Pay attention to flashback. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. Use personal protective
equipment. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing.

See Section 12 for additional Ecological Information

6.2 Environmental precautions

 

Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system.
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains.

6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up

 

Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust)

 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

 

7.1 Precautions for safe handling

Wear personal protective equipment. Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Remove and
wash contaminated clothing before re-use. Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product. Use only in area provided with
appropriate exhaust ventilation. To avoid ignition of vapors by static electricity discharge, all metal parts of the equipment must be
grounded. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. No smoking. Take necessary action to avoid static electricity discharge
(which might cause ignition of organic vapors).

 

7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities

 

Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place. Keep out of the reach of children. Keep containers tightly closed in
a cool, well-ventilated place. Keep in properly labeled containers. Keep away from heat.
