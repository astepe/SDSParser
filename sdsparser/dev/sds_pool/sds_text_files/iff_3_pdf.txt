HAZARDS IDENTIFICATIONIrritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory system.Prolonged skin contact, inhalation or ingestion may be harmful.Repeated contact may cause allergic skin reaction.Inhalation may cause CNS effects, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and dizziness.Chronic ExposureRepeated daily dosing of large amount to laboratory animals resulted in kidney, blood, and liver effects.Similar effects have not been reported in humans.NIOSH has reported the occurrence of severe lung disease in workers who make or use flavorings.  Accordingto NIOSH, the main respiratory symptoms experienced by workers affected by fixed airways obstructioninclude cough (usually without phlegm) and shortness of breath on exertion.  NIOSH further reports that someworkers may experience fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES:Personal ProtectionAvoid inhalation and contact with skin and eyes.Self contained breathing apparatusand protective clothing is advised for major spills and spills or leaks in confinedareas.MSDS version:8Date created:October 27, 2006Update of section:3,15IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634OSHA MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETINTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCESProduct:APPLE - 17J04AFADate:May 11, 2007Page3 ( 7 )6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES:ProceduresEliminate all ignition sources. Contain spill and recover free product. Absorbremainder on vermiculite or other suitable absorbent materials. Use SodiumHypochlorite solution (bleach) to neutralize odor.7. HANDLING AND STORAGE:Handling ProceduresAvoid excessive inhalation of concentrated vapors.  Follow good manufacturingpractices for housekeeping and personal hygiene.  Wash any exposed skinimmediately after any chemical contact, before breaks and meals, and at the end ofeach work period.  Con taminated clothing and shoes should be thoroughly cleanedbefore re-use.If appropriate, procedures used during the handling of this material should also beused when cleaning equipment or removing residual chemicals from tanks or othercontainers, esp ecially when steam or hot water is used, as this may increase vaporconcentrations in the workplace air.  Where chemicals are openly handled, accessshould be restricted to properly trained employees.:HeatingKeep all heated processes at the lowest necessary temperature in order to minimizeemissions of volatile chemicals into the air.:Storage ConditionsStore in a cool, dry, ventilated area away from heat sources. Keep containers uprightand tightly closed when not in use.8. EXPOSURE CONTROL/PERSONAL PROTECTION:Closed SystemsWhere appropriate, use closed systems to transfer and process this material:IsolationIf appropriate, isolate mixing rooms and other areas where this material is used oropenly handled.  Maintain these areas under negative air pressure relative to the restof the plant.:VentilationUse local exhaust ventilation around open tanks and other open sources of potentialexposures in order to avoid excessive inhalation, including places where thismaterial is openly weighed or measured.  In addition, use general dilutionventilation of thework area to eliminate or reduce possible worker exposures.MSDS version:8Date created:October 27, 2006Update of section:3,15IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634OSHA MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETINTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCESProduct:APPLE - 17J04AFADate:May 11, 2007Page4 ( 7 )8. EXPOSURE CONTROL/PERSONAL PROTECTION:Respiratory ProtectionNo respiratory protection is required during normal operations in a workplace whereengineering controls such as adequate ventilation, etc. are sufficient.If engineering controls and safe work practices are not sufficient, an approved,properly fittedrespirator with organic vapor cartridges or canisters and particulatefilters should be used:a) while engineering controls and appropriate safe work practices and/orprocedures are being implemented; orb) during short term maintenance procedures  when engineering controls are not innormal operation or are not sufficient; orc) if normal operational workplace vapor concentration in the air is increased dueto heat ; ord) during emergencies; ore) if engineering controls and operational practices are not sufficient to reduceairborne concentrations below an established occupational exposure limit.:Skin ProtectionAvoid contact with skin. Use chemical resistant gloves.:Eye ProtectionUse tight-fitting goggles, face shield or safety glasses with side shields if eye contactmight occur.:Exposure MonitoringTo the extent deemed appropriate, use an experienced air sampling expert toidentify and measure volatile chemicals that could be present in the workplace air todetermine potential exposures and to ensure the continuing effectiveness ofengineering controls and operational practices to minimize exposure.:Worker Health MonitoringTo the extent deemed appropriate, implement pre-placement and regularlyscheduled ascertainment of symptoms and spirometry testing of lung function forworkers who are regularly exposed to this material.:Additional InformationIn December 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health("NIOSH") published an Alert on preventing lung disease in workers who use ormake flavorings. [NIOSH Publication Number 2004-110]In August 2004, the United States Flavor andExtract Manufacturers Association(FEMA) issued a report entitled "Respiratory Safety in the Flavor ManufacturingWorkplace".Both of these reports provide recommendations for reducing employee exposureand for medical surveillance in the workplace. The recommendations in thesereports are generally applicable to the use of any chemical in the workplace and youare strongly urged to review both of these reports.The report published by FEMA also contains a list of "high priority" chemicals. Ifany of these chemicals are present in this product at a concentration >= 1.0% due toan intentional addition by IFF, the chemical(s) will be identified in this safety datasheet.MSDS version:8Date created:October 27, 2006Update of section:3,15IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810IFF USA FLAVORS (SOUTH BRUNSWICK)150 Docks Corner RoadDayton NJ 08810Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634Phone(1) 732 329 4600Fax(1) 732 329 5634OSHA MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETINTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCESProduct:APPLE - 17J04AFADate:May 11, 2007Page5 ( 7 )9.
