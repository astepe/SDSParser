Since product handling and release scenarios vary, and no two workplaces are exactly alike, it is recommended that the potential for exposure be assessed prior to the product’s use or introduction. Exposure assessments should be performed by an occupational hygienist, industrial hygienist, or other qualified occupational or environmental health professional. An exposure assessment should be conducted to determine the efficacy of any ventilation and the need for additional respiratory protection.  Engineering measures Ventilation: Use engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposures limit requirements or guidelines, use only with adequate ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.

Eye protection : Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location. Wear chemical splash goggles (non-vented) with faceshield.  Hand protection : Wear chemical resistant gloves suitable for this material as determined by a hazard assessment. Gloves should be discarded and replaced if there is any indication of degradation or chemical breakthrough.  Skin and body protection : Wear protective clothing  suitable for this material as determined by a hazard assessment.  Respiratory protection : Respiratory protection should be worn when workplace exposures exceed exposure limit requirements or guidelines. If there are no applicable exposure limits or guidelines, use an approved respirator where there is a potential for adverse effects, including but not limited to respiratory irritation or odor, where indicated or required by the exposure assessment. Selection of air-purifying or positive-pressure supplied air will depend on the results of the exposure assessment which includes an evaluation of the specific operations and the actual or potential airborne concentrations.  The type of car-tridge or filter to be used must be selected and approved for the chemical, class, or classes of chemical(s) likely to be encountered in the workplace. For emergency conditions, use an approved positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus.  Hygiene measures : Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. Remove contaminated clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas. Wash hands before breaks and immediately after handling the product.  See Section 16 for further information.
