Keep victim under observation.Symptoms may be delayed.General informationTake off all contaminated clothing immediately. Ensure that medical personnel are aware of thematerial(s) involved, and take precautions to protect themselves. Wash contaminated clothingbefore reuse.5. Fire-fighting measuresSuitable extinguishing mediaAlcohol resistant foam. Water fog. Dry chemical powder. Carbon dioxide (CO2).Unsuitable extinguishingmediaDo not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread the fire.Specific hazards arising fromthe chemicalVapors may form explosive mixtures with air. Vapors may travel considerable distance to a sourceof ignition and flash back. During fire, gases hazardous to health may be formed.Special protective equipmentand precautions forfirefightersSelf-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire.Fire-fightingequipment/instructionsIn case of fire and/or explosion do not breathe fumes. Move containers from fire area if you can doso without risk.Specific methodsUse standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials.General fire hazardsFlammable liquid and vapor.6. Accidental release measuresPersonal precautions,protective equipment andemergency proceduresKeep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Keep out oflow areas. Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area).Wear appropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not touch damagedcontainers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing. Ventilate closed spacesbefore entering them. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot becontained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.2 / 9Company name:  PepsiCo Inc.Revision date:  09-04-2015Product code:  F0000004049 / v1Product name:  BLOOD ORANGE LIME FLAVORDocument version:  01SDS USMethods and materials forcontainment and cleaning upEliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks, or flames in immediate area). Takeprecautionary measures against static discharge. Use only non-sparking tools. Keep combustibles(wood, paper, oil, etc.) away from spilled material.Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Use water spray to reduce vapors ordivert vapor cloud drift. Dike the spilled material, where this is possible. Cover with plastic sheet toprevent spreading. Use a non-combustible material like vermiculite, sand or earth to soak up theproduct and place into a container for later disposal. Prevent product from entering drains.Following product recovery, flush area with water.Small Spills: Absorb with earth, sand or other non-combustible material and transfer to containersfor later disposal. Clean surface thoroughly to remove residual contamination.Never return spills to original containers for re-use. For waste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.Environmental precautionsAvoid release to the environment. Inform appropriate managerial or supervisory personnel of allenvironmental releases. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Avoid discharge intodrains, water courses or onto the ground.7. Handling and storagePrecautions for safe handlingDo not handle, store or open near an open flame, sources of heat or sources of ignition. Protectmaterial from direct sunlight. When using do not smoke. Explosion-proof general and local exhaustventilation. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. All equipment used whenhandling the product must be grounded. Use non-sparking tools and explosion-proof equipment.Avoid contact with eyes. Avoid prolonged exposure. Wear appropriate personal protectiveequipment. Avoid release to the environment. Observe good industrial hygiene practices.Conditions for safe storage,including anyincompatibilitiesKeep away from heat, sparks and open flame. Prevent electrostatic charge build-up by usingcommon bonding and grounding techniques. Store in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Storein original tightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Refrigeration recommended.Keep in an area equipped with sprinklers. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10of the SDS).8.
