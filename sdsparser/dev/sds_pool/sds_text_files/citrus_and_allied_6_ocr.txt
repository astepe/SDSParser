4.1 Description of first-aid measures

 

General advice Immediate medical attention is required Show this material safety data sheet to the doctor
in attendance. If symptoms persist, call a physician

Eye contact Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 minutes If
symptoms persist, call a physician Immediately flush with plenty of water. After initial
flushing, remove any contact lenses and continue flushing for at least 15 minutes Keep eye
wide open while rinsing

Skin contact Wash off immediately with plenty of water. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before
re-use. If skin irritation persists, call a physician. Wash off immediately with soap and plenty
of water. Immediate medical attention is not required. Wash off immediately with soap and
plenty of water while removing all contaminated clothes and shoes.

Ingestion Do NOT induce vomiting. Drink plenty of water. Immediate medical attention is not required.
Rinse mouth. Clean mouth with water and drink afterwards plenty of water. Never give
anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Consult a physician.

Inhalation Move to fresh air. If symptoms persist, call a physician. Immediate medical attention is not
required. Move to fresh air in case of accidental inhalation of vapors. Move to fresh air in
case of accidental inhalation of vapors or decomposition products.

Protection of First-aiders Remove all sources of ignition Use personal protective equipment

5.3 Advice for firefighters

 

Special protective equipment for fire-fighters
As in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear

 

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

 

6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures

 

Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuate personnel to safe areas. Ensure adequate ventilation. Use personal protective equipment.
Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Pay attention to flashback. Take precautionary measures against static
discharges.

See Section 12 for additional Ecological Information

6.2 Environmental precautions

 

Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains. Do not flush into surface water or sanitary
sewer system.

6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up

 

Soak up with inert absorbent material (e.g. sand, silica gel, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust)

 

7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

 

7.1 Precautions for safe handling

Ensure adequate ventilation. Keep away from open flames, hot surfaces and sources of ignition. Take precautionary measures
against static discharges. Use only in an area containing flame proof equipment. To avoid ignition of vapors by static electricity
discharge, all metal parts of the equipment must be grounded. Use only in area provided with appropriate exhaust ventilation. Wear
personal protective equipment. Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. No smoking.
Take necessary action to avoid static electricity discharge (which might cause ignition of organic vapors).

 

7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities

 

Keep tightly closed in a dry and cool place. Keep in properly labeled containers. Keep containers tightly closed in a cool,
well-ventilated place. Keep away from heat.
