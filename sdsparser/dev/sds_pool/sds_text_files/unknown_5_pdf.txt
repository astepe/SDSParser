US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.PROTECTIVE MEASURESAvoid contact with spilled material.  Warn or evacuate occupants in surrounding and downwind areas if required due to toxicity or flammability of the material.  Dust Deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an explosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration.  Avoid dispersal of dust in the air (for example, clearing dust surfaces with compressed air).  Prevent dust exposure to ignition sources.  For example, use non-sparking tools and prohibit smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective equipment.

Scrape up spilled material with shovels into a suitable container for recycle or disposal.Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other shipping.  Skim from surface.Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONSPrevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. SECTION 7HANDLING AND STORAGEHANDLINGMinimize dust generation and accumulation.  Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.  Dust from material can accumulate electrostatic charges due to friction from transfer and mixing operations and cause an electrical spark (ignition source).  Provide adequate precautions to ignition sources, such as electrical grounding and bonding, inert atmosphere or non-sparking tools. However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard for static accumulation.  Consult local applicable standards for guidance.  Refer to NFPA 654, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust Explosions from the Manufacturing, Processing, and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids and EN 61241, Electrical Apparatus  Product Name:   NEO PENTANOIC ACID Revision Date:  29 Mar 2018 Page 5 of 12 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________for Use in the Presence of Combustible Dust for safe handling.  Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area).  Avoid contact with skin.  Avoid contact with eyes.  When heated, the vapors/fumes given off may cause respiratory tract irritation. Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard.
