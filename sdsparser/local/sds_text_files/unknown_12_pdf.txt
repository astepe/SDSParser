Fire-fighting measuresPromptly isolate the scene by removing all persons from the vicinity of the incident if there is a fire.  No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.  Move containers from fire area if this can be done without risk.  Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool.Hazardous thermal decomposition productsSpecific hazards arising from the chemicalDecomposition products may include the following materials:carbon dioxidecarbon monoxidenitrogen oxidesmetal oxide/oxidesFlammable aerosol.  In a fire or if heated, a pressure increase will occur and the container may burst, with the risk of a subsequent explosion.  Gas may accumulate in low or confined areas or travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back, causing fire or explosion.  Bursting aerosol containers may be propelled from a fire at high speed.  Runoff to sewer may create fire or explosion hazard.Fire-fighters should wear appropriate protective equipment and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece operated in positive pressure mode.Special protective equipment for fire-fightersUse an extinguishing agent suitable for the surrounding fire.Extinguishing media:::None known.Suitable extinguishing media:Unsuitable extinguishing media:Special protective actions for fire-fighters:6. Accidental release measuresEnvironmental precautionsPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures::No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.Evacuate surrounding areas.  Keep unnecessary and unprotected personnel from entering.  In the case of aerosols being ruptured, care should be taken due to the rapid escape of the pressurized contents and propellant.  If a large number of containers are ruptured, treat as a bulk material spillage according to the instructions in the clean-up section.  Do not touch or walk through spilled material.  Shut off all ignition sources.  No flares, smoking or flames in hazard area.  Do not breathe vapor or mist.  Provide adequate ventilation.  Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate.  Put on appropriate personal protective equipment.Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains and sewers.  Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers, waterways, soil or air).Stop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Dilute with water and mop up if water-soluble.  Alternatively,or if water-insoluble, absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container.  Absorb spillage to prevent material damage.  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.Small spill:Methods and materials for containment and cleaning upFor non-emergency personnelFor emergency responders:If specialised clothing is required to deal with the spillage, take note of any information in Section 8 on suitable and unsuitable materials.

Accidental release measuresStop leak if without risk.  Move containers from spill area.  Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Absorb spillage to prevent material damage.  Approach release from upwind.  Prevent entry into sewers, water courses, basements or confined areas.  Wash spillages into an effluent treatment plant or proceed as follows.  Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible, absorbent material e.g. sand, earth,vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal according to local regulations (see Section 13).  Dispose of via a licensed waste disposal contractor.Contaminated absorbent material may pose the same hazard as the spilled product.Note: see Section 1 for emergency contact information and Section 13 for waste disposal.Large spill:7. Handling and storageConditions for safe storage,including any incompatibilitiesDo not store above the following temperature: 50°C (122°F).  Store in accordance with local regulations.  Store away from direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area,away from incompatible materials (see Section 10) and food and drink.  Store in corrosive resistant container with a resistant inner liner.  Store locked up.  Eliminate all ignition sources.  Use appropriate containment to avoid environmental contamination.:Protective measuresPut on appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8).  Pressurized container: protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures exceeding 50°C.  Do not pierce or burn, even after use.  Do not get in eyes or on skin or clothing.  Do not breathe vapor or mist.  Do not ingest.  Avoid breathing gas.  Use only with adequate ventilation.  Wear appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate.  Store and use away from heat, sparks, open flame or any other ignition source.  Use explosion-proof electrical (ventilating, lighting and material handling) equipment.  Use only non-sparking tools.

Respirator selection must be based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe working limits of the selected respirator.Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary.  Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties.  It should be noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove manufacturers.  In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,gases or dusts.  If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection:  chemical splash goggles and/or face shield.  If inhalation hazards exist, a full-face respirator may be required instead.Eye/face protectionRespiratory protection:::Body protectionPersonal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.  When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti-static protective clothing.  For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing should include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.:Environmental exposure controls:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation.  In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.Appropriate engineering controls:Use only with adequate ventilation.  If user operations generate dust, fumes, gas, vapor or mist, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory limits.  The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits.  Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment.Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.Wash contaminated clothing before reusing.  Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.Hygiene measures:Individual protection measuresSkin protectionOther skin protection:Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.6/1413/10/2014.Date of issue:SDS #FF371752_5 (371752PSDS v3.0):Code #371752PSDS v3.0:371752PSDS v3.0Conforms to USDOL OSHA 29CFR 1910.1200 HAZCOM9.
