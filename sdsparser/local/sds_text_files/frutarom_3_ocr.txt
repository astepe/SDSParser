controls. If respirator is sole. means of protection, use a full eface air respirator. Use respirators and components
tested-and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CE N (EU).

In case of brief exposure or low pollution use respiratory filter device. In case of intensive or longer exposure
use respiratOry protective device that is independent of circulating air.
Use of dust—mask recommended when handling open packaging

-' Protection of hands:

Protecti ve gloves

 

7779 glove material has to be impermeable and resistant to the product/ the substance/ the preparation.
Due to missing tests no recommendation to the glove material can be given for the produc’t/ the preparation/ the
chemical miXtu‘re.
Selection of the git/ave material on consideration of the penetration times, rates of diffu$ion and the degradation

- Material of gloves
7776 selection ofgthe suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality
and varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

' Penetration time of glove material
777e exact break; through time has to be found out by the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be
observed. :

3 Eye protection:

  

Tightly sealed goggles

Use equp'ment for eye protection tested and approved under appropriate government standards such. as NI 05H
