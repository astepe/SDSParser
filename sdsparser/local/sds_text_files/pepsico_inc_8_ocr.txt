4. Fl RST-AID MEASURES

Inhalation Move to fresh air. Get medical attention, if needed.

Skin contact Rinse with water. Get medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Eye contact Rinse with water. Get medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion Rinse mouth. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested the substance. If

ingestion of a large amount does occur, call a poison control centre immediately.

5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

Suitable extinguishing media Water fog. Foam. Dry chemical powder. Carbon dioxide (C02).

6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Containment procedures Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this is
possible. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.

Personal precautions Keep unnecessary personnel away. Keep upwind. Keep out of low areas. Do not touch
damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing.

Environmental precautions Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not contaminate water.

Methods for cleaning up Large Spills: Prevent product from entering drains. Do not allow material to contaminate

ground water system. Dike far ahead of spill for later disposal. Use a non-combustible
material like vermiculite, sand or earth to soak up the product and place into a container
for later disposal.

Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface
thoroughly to remove residual contamination.

Never return spills in original containers for re-use.

Hygiene measures

Good general ventilation (typically 10 air changes per hour) should be used. Ventilation
rates should be matched to conditions. If applicable, use process enclosures, local
exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to maintain airborne levels below
recommended exposure limits. If exposure limits have not been established, maintain
airborne levels to an acceptable level.

When workers are facing concentrations above the exposure limit they must use
appropriate certified respirators.

Not normally needed.

Not normally needed.

No special protective equipment required.

Use personal protective equipment as required. Keep working clothes separately.
Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practices.
