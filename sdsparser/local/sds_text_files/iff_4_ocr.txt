Personal precautions

Environmental precautions

Methods for containment /
Methods for cleaning up

Avoid inhalation and contact with skin and eyes. A self~contained
breathing apparatus is recommended in case of a major spill.

Keep away from drains, surface— and groundwater and soil.

Cleanup spillage promptly. Remove ignition sources. Provide
adequate ventilation. Avoid excessive inhalation of vapours. Gross
spillages should be contained by use of sand or inert powder and
disposed of according to the local regulations.

 

Handling

Advice on protection against fire
and explosion

Avoid excessive inhalation of concentrated vapors. Follow good
manufacturing practices for housekeeping and personal hygiene.
Wa‘shiany exposed skin immediately after any chemical contact,
before breaks and meals, and at the end of each work period.
Contaminated clothing and shoes should be thoroughly cleaned
before re-use.

if appropriate, procedures used during the handling of this material
should also be used when cleaning eQuipment or removing residual
chemicals from tanks or other containers, especially when steam or
hot water is used, as this may increase vapor concentrations in the
'workplace air. Where chemicals are openly handled, access should be
restricted to properly trained employees.

Keep all heated processes at the lowest necessary temperature in
order to minimize emissions of volatile chemicals into the air.

Keep away from ignition sources and naked flame.

Personal protective equipment

Eye protection

Hand protection

Respiratory protection

Where feasible, isolate mixing rooms and other areas where this
material is used or openly handled. Maintain these areas under
negative air pressure relative to the rest of the plant.

Where feasible, use closed systems to transfer and process this
material '

Use tight-ﬁtting goggles, face shield or safety glasses with side
shields if eye contact might occur.

Avoid skin contact. Use chemically resistant gloves.

Use local exhaust ventilation around open tanks and other open
sources of potentialexposures in order to avoid excessive inhalation,
including places where this material is openly weighed or measured.
In addition, use general dilution ventilation of the work area to
eliminate or reduce possible worker exposures.

No respiratory protection is required during normal operations in a
workplace where engineering controls such as adequate ventilation,
etc. are sufﬁcient. ‘

,lf engineering controls and safe work practices are not sufﬁcient, an
approved, properly fitted respirator with organic vapor cartridges or
canisters and particulate filters should be used:

a)while engineering controls and appropriate safe work practices
and/or procedures are being implemented; or

b)during short term maintenance procedures when engineering
controls are not in normal operation or are not sufﬁcient; or

Hygiene measures

Protective measures

c)if normal operational workplace vapor concentration in the air is
increased due to heat ;

d)during emergencies; or

e)if engineering controls and operational practices are not sufﬁcient
to reduce airborne concentrations below an established occupational
exposure limit.

: To the extent deemed appropriate, implement pre—placement and

regularly scheduled ascertainment of symptoms and spirometry
testing of lung function for workers who are regularly exposed to
this material.
To the extent deemed appropriate, use an experienced air sampling
expert to identify and measure volatile chemicals that could be
present in the workplace air to determine potential exposures and to
ensure the continuing effectiveness of engineering controls and

' operational practices to minimize exposure.

111 December 2003, the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health ("NIOSH") published an Alert on preventing lung
disease in workers who use or make ﬂavorings [NIOSH Publication
Number 2004~l 10].
In August 2004 the United States Flavor and Extract Manufacturers
Association (FEMA) issued a report entitled "Respiratory Safety 1n
the Flavor Manufacturing Workplace"

1 Both of these reports provide recommendations for reducing

‘ employee exposure and for medical surveillance 1n the workplace.
The recommendations in these reports are generally applicable to the
use of any chemical in the workplace and you are strongly urged to
review both of these reports.
The report published by FEMA also contains a list of "high priority"
chemicals. if any of these chemicals are present in this product at a
concentration >= 1.0% due to an intentional addition by IFF, the
chemical(s) will be identiﬁed in this safety data sheet.
