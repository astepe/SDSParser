Never give anything bymouth to an unconscious person.  Get medical attention immediately.Get medical attention immediately.  Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15minutes, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids.  Check for and remove any contactlenses.  Chemical burns must be treated promptly by a physician.Flush contaminated skin with plenty of water.  Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.  Getmedical attention if symptoms occur.  Wash clothing before reuse.  Clean shoes thoroughlybefore reuse.Move exposed person to fresh air.  If it is suspected that fumes are still present, the rescuershould wear an appropriate mask or self-contained breathing apparatus.  Keep person warmand at rest.  If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest occurs, provideartificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel.  It may be dangerous to the personproviding aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  Get medical attention.  If unconscious,place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately.

Vapor may cause flash fire.  Vapors may accumulate in low orconfined areas or travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back.  Runoffto sewer may create fire or explosion hazard.Special protectiveequipment for fire-fightersFire-fighters should wear appropriate protective equipment and self-contained breathingapparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece operated in positive pressure mode.:::::::Extinguishing mediaFire/explosion hazardsUse dry chemical, CO2, water spray (fog) or foam.:SuitableNot suitableImmediately contact emergency personnel.  Eliminate all ignition sources.  Keep unnecessarypersonnel away.  Use suitable protective equipment.  Do not touch or walk through spilledmaterial.If emergency personnel are unavailable, contain spilled material.  For small spills, addabsorbent (soil may be used in the absence of other suitable materials) and use a non-sparkingor explosion-proof means to transfer material to a sealable, appropriate container for disposal.For large spills, dike spilled material or otherwise contain material to ensure runoff does notreach a waterway.  Place spilled material in an appropriate container for disposal.Environmental precautionsand clean-up methodsSection 6. Accidental release measures:Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil, waterways, drains andsewers.Personal precautions:Store in a segregated and approved area.  Keep container in a cool, well-ventilated area.  Keepcontainer tightly closed and sealed until ready for use.  Avoid all possible sources of ignition(spark or flame).Do not ingest.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.  Keep container closed.  Use onlywith adequate ventilation.  Avoid breathing vapor or mist.  Keep away from heat, sparks andflame.  To avoid fire or explosion, dissipate static electricity during transfer by grounding andbonding containers and equipment before transferring material.  Use explosion-proof electrical(ventilating, lighting and material handling) equipment.  Wash thoroughly after handling.Section 7. Handling and storageHandlingStorage::Provide exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep the airborne concentrations ofvapors below their respective occupational exposure limits.  Ensure that eyewash stations andsafety showers are close to the workstation location.Section 8. Exposure controls, personal protectionEngineering controlsUse appropriate respiratory protection if there is a risk of exceeding any exposure limits.Safety glasses. Goggles, face shield or other full-face protection should be worn if there is a riskof direct exposure to aerosols or splashes.Additional body garments should be used to avoid exposed skin surfaces (e.g. sleevelets,apron, disposable suit etc.), based on the task being performed.  Appropriate techniques shouldbe used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.Personal protectionEyesSkinRespiratoryPersonal protectiveequipment (Pictograms)Not available.:::::Use chemical-resistant, impervious gloves.Hands:Page: 3/6Build 1.3.7NATURAL CITRUS ENHANCERD6230(17804ACN)Liquid.Not available.Colorless.Section 9.
