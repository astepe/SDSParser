Ensure adequate ventilation, especially in confined areas.

Individual protectiOn measures, such as personal protective equipment

Eye/face protection
Skin and body protection

Respiratory Protection

General Hygiene Considerations

Tight sealing safety goggles. Face protection shield.

Wear protective gloves and protective clothing.

lf exposure limits are exceeded or irritation is experienced, NIOSH/MSHA approved
respiratory protection should be worn. Positive—pressure supplied air respirators may be
required for high airborne contaminant concentrations. Respiratory protection must be
provided in accordance with. current local regulations.

When using, do not eat, drink or smoke. Regular cleaning of equipment, work area and

clothing.
