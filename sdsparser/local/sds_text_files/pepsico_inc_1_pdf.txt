First-aid measuresMove to fresh air. Call a physician if symptoms develop or persist.InhalationTake off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water/shower. Call a physician orpoison control center immediately. Chemical burns must be treated by a physician. Washcontaminated clothing before reuse.Skin contactImmediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, ifpresent and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Call a physician or poison control center immediately.Eye contactCall a physician or poison control center immediately. Rinse mouth. Do not induce vomiting. Ifvomiting occurs, keep head low so that stomach content doesn't get into the lungs.IngestionBurning pain and severe corrosive skin damage. Causes serious eye damage. Symptoms mayinclude stinging, tearing, redness, swelling, and blurred vision. Permanent eye damage includingblindness could result.Most importantsymptoms/effects, acute anddelayedProvide general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. Chemical burns: Flush with waterimmediately. While flushing, remove clothes which do not adhere to affected area. Call anambulance. Continue flushing during transport to hospital. Keep victim under observation.Symptoms may be delayed.Indication of immediatemedical attention and specialtreatment neededEnsure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved, and take precautions toprotect themselves.General information5.

Accidental release measuresKeep unnecessary personnel away. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Wearappropriate protective equipment and clothing during clean-up. Do not breathe mist or vapor. Donot touch damaged containers or spilled material unless wearing appropriate protective clothing.Ensure adequate ventilation. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot becontained. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.Personal precautions,protective equipment andemergency proceduresUse water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift.Large Spills: Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk. Dike the spilled material, where this ispossible. Absorb in vermiculite, dry sand or earth and place into containers. Following productrecovery, flush area with water.Small Spills: Wipe up with absorbent material (e.g. cloth, fleece). Clean surface thoroughly toremove residual contamination.Never return spills to original containers for re-use.
