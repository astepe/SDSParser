FIRST AID MEASURESFirst aid measures for different exposure routesGeneral adviceIf symptoms persist, call a physician. Eye contactImmediately flush with plenty of water. After initial flushing, remove any contact lensesand continue flushing for at least 15 minutes. Keep eye wide open while rinsing. Ifsymptoms persist, call a physician. Skin contactImmediate medical attention is not required. Wash off immediately with soap and plentyof water while removing all contaminated clothes and shoes. If skin irritation persists,call a physician. InhalationImmediate medical attention is not required. If symptoms persist, call a physician. Moveto fresh air in case of accidental inhalation of vapors or decomposition products. IngestionClean mouth with water and afterwards drink plenty of water. Never give anything bymouth to an unconscious person. Consult a physician. Do not induce vomiting. Protection of first-aidersUse personal protective equipment. Most important symptoms/effects, acute and delayedIndication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessaryNotes to physicianTreat symptomatically. 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURESSuitable extinguishing mediaUse:. Dry chemical. Carbon dioxide (CO 2). Water spray. Alcohol-resistant foam. Flammable PropertiesCombustible liquid Unsuitable Extinguishing MediaDo not use a solid water stream as it may scatter and spread fire. Specific hazards arising from the chemicalKeep product and empty container away from heat and sources of ignition. Risk of ignition. Explosion DataSensitivity to Mechanical Impactnone. Sensitivity to Static DischargeYes. Protective equipment and precautions for firefightersAs in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and full protective gear. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURESPersonal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures Personal precautionsUse personal protective equipment. Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuatepersonnel to safe areas. Keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Pay attentionto flashback. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. Environmental precautions Environmental precautionsBeware of vapors accumulating to form explosive concentrations. Vapors canaccumulate in low areas. Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewersystem. Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product fromentering drains. Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up Methods for ContainmentPrevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Methods for cleaning upSoak up with inert absorbent material. Dam up. Pick up and transfer to properly labeledcontainers. Take precautionary measures against static discharges. 7. HANDLING AND STORAGEPrecautions for safe handlingAdvice on safe handlingUse only in area provided with appropriate exhaust ventilation. To avoid ignition ofvapors by static electricity discharge, all metal parts of the equipment must begrounded. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame. No smoking. Wear personalprotective equipment. Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Take necessary action toavoid static electricity discharge (which might cause ignition of organic vapors). Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilitiesTechnical measures/Storage conditionsKeep away from heat and sources of ignition. Keep containers tightly closed in a cool,well-ventilated place. Keep away from heat. Keep in properly labeled containers. Incompatible productsNone known based on information supplied. 8.
