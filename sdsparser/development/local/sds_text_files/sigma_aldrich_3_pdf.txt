EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 8.1 Control parameters Components with workplace control parameters Contains no substances with occupational exposure limit values. 8.2 Exposure controls Appropriate engineering controls General industrial hygiene practice. Personal protective equipment Eye/face protection Use equipment for eye protection tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or EN 166(EU). Skin protection Handle with gloves. Gloves must be inspected prior to use. Use proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface) to avoid skin contact with this product. Dispose of contaminated gloves after use in accordance with applicable laws and good laboratory practices. Wash and dry hands.  Body Protection Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and to the specific work-place., The type of protective equipment must be selected according to the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace. Respiratory protection Respiratory protection is not required. Where protection from nuisance  levels of dusts are desired, use type N95 (US) or type P1 (EN 143) dust masks. Use respirators and components tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU). Control of environmental exposure Do not let product enter drains.   9.
