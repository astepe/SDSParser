FIREFIGHTING MEASURES 5.1 Extinguishing media Suitable extinguishing media For small (incipient) fires, use media such as "alcohol" foam, dry chemical, or carbon dioxide. For large fires, apply water from as far as possible. Use very large quantities (flooding) of water applied as a mist or spray; solid streams of water may be ineffective. Cool all affected containers with flooding quantities of water. 5.2 Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture No data available 5.3 Advice for firefighters Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if necessary. 5.4 Further information Use water spray to cool unopened containers.  6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES 6.1 Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures Use personal protective equipment. Avoid breathing vapours, mist or gas. Ensure adequate ventilation. Remove all sources of ignition. Evacuate personnel to safe areas. Beware of vapours accumulating to form explosive concentrations. Vapours can accumulate in low areas. For personal protection see section 8. 6.2 Environmental precautions Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains. 6.3 Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up Contain spillage, and then collect with an electrically protected vacuum cleaner or by wet-brushing and place in container for disposal according to local regulations (see section 13). 6.4 Reference to other sections For disposal see section 13.  7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 7.1 Precautions for safe handling Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid inhalation of vapour or mist. Keep away from sources of ignition - No smoking.Take measures to prevent the build up of electrostatic charge. For precautions see section 2.2. 7.2 Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities Store in cool place. Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place. Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage.  Recommended storage temperature 2 - 8 °C Moisture sensitive.  7.3 Specific end use(s) Apart from the uses mentioned in section 1.2 no other specific uses are stipulated  8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 8.1 Control parameters Components with workplace control parameters Contains no substances with occupational exposure limit values.  Aldrich - W244406  Page 4  of  8  8.2 Exposure controls Appropriate engineering controls Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday. Personal protective equipment Eye/face protection Face shield and safety glasses Use equipment for eye protection tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or EN 166(EU). Skin protection Handle with gloves. Gloves must be inspected prior to use. Use proper glove removal technique (without touching glove's outer surface) to avoid skin contact with this product. Dispose of contaminated gloves after use in accordance with applicable laws and good laboratory practices. Wash and dry hands.  Body Protection Impervious clothing, Flame retardant antistatic protective clothing., The type of protective equipment must be selected according to the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace. Respiratory protection Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-face respirator with multi-purpose combination (US) or type ABEK (EN 14387) respirator cartridges as a backup to engineering controls. If the respirator is the sole means of protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. Use respirators and components tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU). Control of environmental exposure Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains.  9.
