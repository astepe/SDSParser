Thermal decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.NFPA  6. Accidental release measuresPersonal PrecautionsUse personal protective equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation. Do not get in eyes, onskin, or on clothing.Environmental PrecautionsPrevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent product from entering drains.See Section 12 for additional ecological information. Do not flush into surface water orsanitary sewer system.Methods for Containment and CleanUpSoak up with inert absorbent material. Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal.7.
