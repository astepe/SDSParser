Containers may explode when heated. Keep product and empty container away from heat and sources ofignition.Hazardous Combustion ProductsCarbon monoxide (CO) Carbon dioxide (CO2) Gaseous hydrogen fluoride (HF)Protective Equipment and Precautions for FirefightersAs in any fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent) and fullprotective gear. Thermal decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.NFPA  6. Accidental release measuresPersonal PrecautionsUse personal protective equipment. Remove all sources of ignition. Avoid contact with skin,eyes and clothing. Take precautionary measures against static discharges.Environmental PrecautionsShould not be released into the environment. See Section 12 for additional ecologicalinformation.Methods for Containment and CleanUpRemove all sources of ignition. Soak up with inert absorbent material. Keep in suitable,closed containers for disposal.7. Handling and storageHandlingWear personal protective equipment. Keep away from open flames, hot surfaces andsources of ignition. Do not breathe vapors or spray mist. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.Do not ingest.StorageKeep containers tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated place.
