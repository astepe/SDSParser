## sds_parser
sds_parser is a browser-based app for extracting chemical data from Safety Data Sheet documents. sds_parser will speed up your
data-entry process by eliminating the need to read through countless Safety Data Sheets to get the data you care about.

## Motivation
Built out of the need to quickly access chemical data from Safety Data Sheets for data-entry purposes. Each chemical manufacturer will stylize and structure their SDSs a little bit differently. sds_parser can easily be updated to read a new manufacturer format by adding a new set of regular expressions to match the format that that specific manufacturer uses. 

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
* [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer), a tool for extracting information from PDF documents
* [tesseract-ocr](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/), a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR

## Features
Have some physical SDSs you need to scan and get data from? Have no fear, sds_parser will recognize your scanned file as an image and perform optical character recognition to extract the text for you.
